### Required Libraries

You should download and install the following libraries to the same location as this README.md file:

- getID3 (lib/getid3/getid3.php)
- Twig (lib/Twig/Autoloader.php)

These libraries are required for the website to function correctly.

### Database Auth

Enter database authentication information into the file located at html/includes/config.php

**DO NOT** commit these changes to the GitHub repository.

### Database Setup

Once both of the above steps (required libraries & entering auth details) are done, you can set up your database with the required structure.

Load the website in a browser, and click on the "DEBUG Setup" menu option.
