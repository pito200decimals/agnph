    - Show statistic about # of guests browsing? (not including bots?)

- Give admins ability to ban until a user turns 18
    - Possibly not automatic, should notify/ticket when a user sets birthday to invlaid value
X Enable login via display name???

    - Messy, but doable now that account import is done.


== Things to remember when setting up site ==
- max_upload_filesize in php.ini
- enable mod_rewrite in httpd.conf
- enable module gd (for swf size info)
- Install sendmail
- Suppress PHP logging on errors.
- When importing accounts, add prefix/suffix to usernames to avoid duplicates when users re-register.
- set import crypt salt.

== Things to ensure when end-to-end testing site ==
- Ensure registered but un-activated users don't 'exist' (as they could be deleted at any time)

== Things to do when importing accounts ==
- Prevent account username/displayname from starting with a digit
- Add prefix to all usernames
