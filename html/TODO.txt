    - Messy, but doable now that account import is done.


== Things to remember when setting up site ==
- max_upload_filesize in php.ini
- enable mod_rewrite in httpd.conf
- enable module gd (for swf size info)
- Install sendmail
- Suppress PHP logging on errors.
- When importing accounts, add prefix/suffix to usernames to avoid duplicates when users re-register.
- set import crypt salt.
- vhost.conf or httpd.conf:
    AllowEncodedSlashes NoDecode
