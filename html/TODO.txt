X Search by newly-tagged?
X Gallery linking to source on delete
X Collapse adjacent image pools
X IP address tracking for uploads (Do we need this, since user is tracked?)

X Gallery notes
X Custom swf/webm thumbs when parent is set to image.

== FICS ==
- Update tag counts to handle deleted stories
- Chapter template should have better margins (is 30px enough?)
    - Narrow-column toggle
- Author list page performance
- Include co-authors in author list.
X Author/Story following?
X Ability to subscribe for email/PM notifications (for your stories and watching others)
X RSS Feed?

== SITE ==
* Check for vuln's for style background-image URL
* Splash for Disclaimer/Warning/Age gate.
    - Add disclaimer banner to non-splash-blocked pages.
* Oekaki section
    - Just a direct way to post to the forums?
- Check htmlentities decoding everywhere.
- Custom 404/error pages
    - 404 done, error pages not all working quite yet.
- Admin staff bio layout on desktop/mobile
    - Check again after bios are done.
- Admin ticket system
    - Integrate admin notification broadcast to this control panel
- Global site statistics?
- API, at least for gallery similar to Ouroboros?
- Multiple themes?
    - All CSS
    - Ensure no colors clash on mobile
- BUGFIX: Tags are lost on fail-to-submit in fancy tagger UI.
- Fix no-script CSS on menubar hover color
X Polls?
X Search string length attacks (Unlikely to be a huge problem).

== ACCOUNT ==
* User Account Imports:
    - Import avatars if none set
* Mailbox/PM system
    - Integration with help ticket system
    X Update unread-message-count to handle inbox thread grouping
    X Support message deletion? For now, no.
- Remove last-active on inactive accounts, and accounts with timestamp 0
- IP addresses as a list, not a string
- Auto-ban underage accounts
- Auto-ban by IP?
- Non-user IP tracking (DoS investigating, user demographic statistics, etc?)
    - Show statistic about # of guests browsing? (not including bots?)
- Display section permissions (better badge icons) [PARTIALLY DONE]
- Give admins ability to ban until a user turns 18
    - Possibly not automatic, should notify/ticket when a user sets birthday to invalid value
X Enable login via display name???
X Allow user account deletion?
    - Messy, but doable now that account import is done.


== Things to remember when setting up site ==
- max_upload_filesize in php.ini
- enable mod_rewrite in httpd.conf
- enable module gd (for swf size info)
- Install sendmail
- Suppress PHP logging on errors.
- When importing accounts, add prefix/suffix to usernames to avoid duplicates when users re-register.
- set import crypt salt.
- vhost.conf or httpd.conf:
    AllowEncodedSlashes NoDecode

== Things to ensure when end-to-end testing site ==
- Ensure registered but un-activated users don't 'exist' (as they could be deleted at any time)

== Things to do when importing accounts ==
- Prevent account username/displayname from starting with a digit
- Add prefix to all usernames
