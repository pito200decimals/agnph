* Splash for Disclaimer/Warning/Age gate.
* Oekaki section
* Admin site management (Ongoing)
* Timezone/date management
    - Should detect on home page, registration, or every page?

- Link news from forums to each section/home page?
- Global site statistics (including user action logging?)
- Polls?

== ACCOUNT ==
* Mailbox/PM system
    - Add unread-message notification to both account tab and inbox tab.
    X Support message deletion? For now, no.
    - Should add user blacklisting?
        - Offending users can be banned.
- Allow users to hide online status
- Global user action logging
- Non-user IP tracking (DoS investigating, user demographic statistics, etc?)
    - Show statistic about # of guests browsing? (not including bots?)
- Ensure registered but un-activated users don't 'exist' (as they could be deleted at any time)
- Perhaps a badge/text to tell users this account was created for archive and hasn't logged in before?
    - Shouldn't be a problem if imported usernames have prefix/suffix
- Display section permissions (better badge icons)
- Handle case when users register with the same name as an archive account.
    - Right now, archive accounts will have modified username, but duplicate display names allowed.
- Prevent account username/displayname from starting with a digit
- Account merge/import system.
- Enable login via display name???
- Change timezone selection to dropdown options
    - Allow DST auto-toggle?

== Things to remember when setting up site ==
- max_upload_filesize in php.ini
- enable mod_rewrite in httpd.conf
- enable module gd (for swf size info)
- Install sendmail
- Suppress PHP logging on errors.
- When importing accounts, add prefix/suffix to usernames to avoid duplicates when users re-register.
