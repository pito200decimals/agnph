TODOs
(* = Required for launch, - = Normal priority, X = Scrapped)

== FORUMS ==
- Re-check forums functionality (Might need a complete re-do)
* Admin lock/move threads
- Reply-to
- Spoiler tags

== GALLERY ==
X Gallery linking to source on delete
- Gallery mass tag edits
    - For a given search, add/remove all tags on matched posts?
- Slideshow view
X IP address tracking for uploads (Do we need this, since user is tracked?)
X Upvote/Downvote (On hold for now. Don't know where to put buttons. Feature not used in Ouroboros gallery)
X Gallery notes
X Custom swf/webm thumbs when parent is set to image.
- Some sort of tag exploration feature, perhaps tag cloud?
- "Popular" recent posts, maybe by # of views in last day/week/month?
- Handle parent cleanup on post delete
    - Move favorites over to parent?
- Tag suggestions
X Collapse adjacent image pools
- Search by newly-tagged

== FICS ==
X Author/Story following?
- Index page, including news and featured stories, perhaps random selection
X Ability to subscribe for email/PM notifications (for your stories and watching others)
X Breakdown of views per-chapter
- Co-authors?
- RSS Feed?
- User restrictions, like gallery, to prevent uploads/comments/reviews.

== SITE ==
* Check for vuln's for style background-image URL
* Search string length attacks.
* Splash for Disclaimer/Warning/Age gate.
* Oekaki section
* Admin site management (Ongoing)
* Timezone/date management
    - Try to auto-detect on registration
* General help pages
* General about section, admin bios, etc.
- Link news from forums to each section/home page?
- Global site statistics (including user action logging?)
- Polls?
- Maintenance mode (no edits)
- Multiple themes?
- Way to push notifications and site updates to users (via PM system?)
    - Include welcome message, and account migration message on registration.
- API, at least for gallery similar to Ouroboros?
- All CSS
- Theme switcher
    - Better skin fallback code
- SQL Table prefixes?

== ACCOUNT ==
* Enable login via email, not just username (Also allow display name?)
* Mailbox/PM system
    - Add unread-message notification to both account tab and inbox tab.
    X Support message deletion? For now, no.
    - Should add user blacklisting?
        - Offending users can be banned.
- Allow users to hide online status
- Global user action logging
- Non-user IP tracking (DoS investigating, user demographic statistics, etc?)
X Allow user account deletion?
    - Messy
- Ensure registered but un-activated users don't 'exist' (as they could be deleted at any time)
- Perhaps a badge/text to tell users this account was created for archive and hasn't logged in before?
    - Shouldn't be a problem if imported usernames have prefix/suffix
- Display section permissions (better badge icons)
- Handle case when users register with the same name as an archive account.
    - Right now, archive accounts will have modified username, but duplicate display names allowed.
- Prevent account username/displayname from starting with a digit
- Account merge/import system.


== Things to remember when setting up site ==
- max_upload_filesize in php.ini
- enable mod_rewrite in httpd.conf
- enable module gd (for swf size info)
- Install sendmail
- Suppress PHP logging on errors.
- When importing accounts, add prefix/suffix to usernames to avoid duplicates when users re-register.
